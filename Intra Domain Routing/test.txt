Testing Strategy and Test Cases Documentation

Overall Testing Strategy
My testing approach focuses on evaluating both Distance Vector (DV) and Link State (LS) routing protocols under various network conditions. The test cases are designed to verify:
1. Protocol convergence and stability
2. Route calculation accuracy
3. Response to topology changes
4. Performance under high-delay and packet loss conditions
5. Path selection optimization


Test1

Purpose:
- Tests protocol behavior in a large network (13 nodes) with frequent topology changes
- Evaluates route convergence after multiple simultaneous link failures

Key Test Scenarios:
- Multiple alternative paths between source and destination
- Sequential link failures and recoveries
- Dynamic delay changes during transmission
- Long-distance route calculations (1 to 15)

Expected Behavior:
- Protocols should quickly adapt to topology changes
- Alternative paths should be found when primary paths fail
- Route convergence should occur within acceptable timeframes


Test2

Purpose:
- Evaluates protocol performance under challenging network conditions
- Tests reliability with varied packet loss probabilities
- Assesses behavior with high-latency links

Key Test Scenarios:
- Links with high delay (up to 120ms)
- Variable packet loss probabilities (10-30%)
- Combination of link failures and delay changes
- Multiple possible paths with different reliability characteristics

Expected Behavior:
- Protocols should maintain connectivity despite packet loss
- Route selection should consider both delay and reliability
- Stable operation under high-latency conditions


Test3

Purpose:
- Tests rapid adaptation to changing network conditions
- Evaluates path selection when multiple alternatives exist
- Assesses protocol stability during frequent route changes

Key Test Scenarios:
- Multiple equal-cost paths between nodes
- Rapid sequence of link failures and recoveries
- Dynamic delay adjustments forcing path recalculation
- Direct vs. indirect path competition

Expected Behavior:
- Quick convergence after topology changes
- Optimal path selection based on current conditions
- Stable routing despite frequent changes


Test4

Purpose:
- Tests protocol resilience to continuous network changes
- Evaluates behavior under cascading topology updates
- Assesses routing stability with frequent state changes

Key Test Scenarios:
- Overlapping link state changes
- Combination of delay changes and link failures
- Regular transmission tests during topology changes
- Mixed delay and reliability conditions

Expected Behavior:
- Maintain consistent routing despite frequent changes
- Proper handling of simultaneous topology updates
- Efficient route recalculation during state changes
